## About

I am a university student with a focus on sport science, interested in the intersection of athletic diagnostics, biomechanics, and data analysis.

My work centers on developing small research-oriented software tools for laboratory-based sports diagnostics, particularly on parsing and combining data from multiple diagnostic modalities. While I have experimented with several technologies, my primary working language is currently C & Python.

Alongside this, I am working on a research-oriented project focused on the geometric representation of human movement (initially applied to running), with concepts transferable to other movements when grounded in biomechanical principles. This work is developed under the Motus Metrics organization and serves as a proof of concept rather than a production system.

These repositories represent exploratory and academic projects connected to my diploma thesis and broader research interests, aiming to bridge sport science, computation, and practical understanding.
