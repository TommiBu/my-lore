I study at a university with a focus on sports science

I'm involved in weightlifting and athletic diagnostics

I'm developing software to expand the diagnostic profile of athletes

I use C++ for computational cores, Java for data processing, and Python for visualizations

I'm a self-taught programmer learning from books and AI tools

Iâ€™ve explored how force measurement devices work on a theoretical level

I see technology as a way to bridge science, sport, and real-world application
