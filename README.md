# About Me – From Sports Science to Data and Technology

Hi! My name is Tomáš Bůžek, and I’m currently finishing my Master’s degree in **Sports Science**. While my academic background is rooted in human performance, physiology, and biomechanics, I’ve developed a strong passion for **technology**, particularly **data analysis**, **Programming**, and **innovation**.

## 🧪 Current Academic Project

As part of my thesis, I’m conducting a **laboratory-based performance assessment** of competitive athletes. The study focuses on:

- Anaerobic power output
- Blood lactate levels
- Body composition
- Grip strength

The subjects are athletes from **four combat sports**, categorized as:
- **Olympic** standing (e.g. boxing)
- **Olympic** ground (e.g. wrestling)
- **Non-Olympic** standing (e.g. kickboxing)
- **Non-Olympic** ground (e.g. grappling)

The goal is to perform **in-depth statistical analysis** and comparison between these athlete groups and explore key physiological factors. This project combines my interest in **applied science** and **data-driven insight**.

## 💻 IT and Data Interests

Although I come from a non-technical field, I’ve actively built skills in:

- **Python** (especially for data analysis and open data exploration)
- **HTML & CSS** (completed a front-end academy course)
- **Java** (self-study - chatgpt, IT community)
- **Cybersecurity** (self-study and concept exploration)

I enjoy working on real-world problems, interpreting data, and turning complex findings into meaningful conclusions. My favorite part of any project is **presenting results**, telling the story behind the numbers, and delivering value to others.

I'm particularly enthusiastic about:
- Projects with social or scientific impact
- Interdisciplinary work (science + tech)
- Learning by doing – especially in real environments

## 🚀 My Goals

I’m looking for opportunities to:
- **Join real-life tech/data projects/programming** (internship, part-time, or mentorship)
- **Contribute to something meaningful** while learning
- Continue growing in **Python development**, **data science**,**Java development** and eventually project design & leadership
- Possibly pursue a **PhD** focused on human data, technology, and innovation

## 🧠 A Bit More About Me

- Passionate about learning and curious by nature – I love physics, biomechanics, and deep-diving into niche topics
- Strong communication skills – I love presenting, collaborating, and working with open-minded people
- Systematic thinker – years of sport taught me to work towards goals with discipline
- Nerd at heart – excited by knowledge, progress, and clever solutions
- Background in hands-on fields – from **CAD architectural design in construction school** to **manual jobs**, but I’ve always felt drawn to innovation and digital environments
- Active **Olympic weightlifter** – recently qualified for the Czech National Championships U23

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration

I'm open to meaningful, flexible collaboration on real-world projects — especially where I can grow my skills in data, Python, or tech development. Let's build something valuable together.
